# Python Crash Course

### My first attempt at learning Python, following the Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.  
  
**NOTE:** I won't spend too much time on the first chapters as I have some experience programming in other languages. I will make notes on topics I see relevant in the "hello_world.py" file as I want to avoid time-consuming tasks that are meant for absolute beginners to programming. As the course starts requiring more involvement, I will start following the instructions more thoroughly.  
  
Also, I used the First Edition of the book for the first 6 Chapters and the Second Edition for the rest, thus why I don't use f-strings in the beginning.
