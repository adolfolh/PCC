# Python Crash Course

My first attempt at learning Python, following the Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.  
NOTE: I won't spend too much time on the first chapters as I have some expirience programming in other languages. Also, I used the First Edition of the book for the first 6 Chapters and the Second Edition for the rest, thus why I don't use f-strings in the beginning.
